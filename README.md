## WITSML

This repository provides a functional WITSML server, originally developed by PDS and
now restored with a proper documentation. It is now updated and maintained to support
the community and industry with a reliable test WITSML server implementation.

### Setup Guide

These setup steps have been tested on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. Follow these steps to set up and build the project:

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
    - Download **Visual Studio 2022** (tested with v17+) [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and install.
    - Add `msbuild` to your user's PATH environment variables:
      ```sh
      # Example path
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\<VERSION>\Msbuild\Current\Bin
      # For instance
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Msbuild\Current\Bin
      ```

3. **Configure IIS Server**:
    - Open IIS Manager and Add Website by right-click on Sites.
      ![iis-add-site](img/iis-add-site.png)
    - Add any site name, set physical path to `<Project-Path>\src\Store` and set your desired port.
      ![iis-add-site2](img/iis-add-site2.png)
    - Add permissions to `<Project-Path>\src\Store` (by right-click on the folder) to IUSR.
      ![iis-add-permission](img/iis-add-permission.png)

5. **Add a User**:
    - Open PowerShell in the `.\src\Store.UserAdmin\bin` folder.
    - Add a user with your desired credentials:
      ```sh
      .\PDS.WITSMLstudio.Store.UserAdmin.exe add -u <Your-Username> -p <Your-Password> -e <Your-Email>
      ```
      ![powershell-create-user](img/powershell-create-user.png)

6. **Connect to the Server**:
    - Access the server at `http://localhost:<IIS-Site-Port>/api/soap` using:
      - **Username**: `<Your-Username>`
      - **Password**: `<Your-Password>`
    - Use [PDS WITSMLstudio Desktop](https://witsml.pds.technology/studio/) if no client is available.

By completing these steps, the project should be successfully set up and ready for use.

### Containerization Guide

> **Note**: Ensure the project is built successfully before proceeding with containerization. MongoDB is not required if you want to containerize the project.

If you want to containerize the server, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Windows Features for Containers**:
  - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable the required Windows features:
    ```sh
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $("Microsoft-Hyper-V", "Containers") -All
    ```
  - Restart your system if required.

2. **Install and Configure Docker**:
  - Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (tested on v4.41+) and install.
  - Ensure Docker is running in **Windows Containers** mode. You can switch to Windows Containers by right-clicking the Docker icon in the system tray and selecting "Switch to Windows Containers."

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container**:
  - Open a terminal in this directory and run the following command to build and start the container:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
  - Once the container is running, the server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Add a User**:
  - Open container PowerShell by running the following command:
    ```sh
    docker exec -it <Your-Container-Name> powershell
    ```
  - Add a user with your desired credentials:
    ```sh
    .\Store.UserAdmin\bin\PDS.WITSMLstudio.Store.UserAdmin.exe add -u <Your-Username> -p <Your-Password> -e <Your-Email>
    ```
