      ![powershell-create-user](img/powershell-create-user.png)

ðŸŽ‰ By completing these steps, the project should be successfully set up and ready for use. ðŸŽ‰

If you want to containerize the server, follow these steps:

6. **Enable Windows Features for Containers**:
    - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable the required Windows features:
      ```sh
      Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $("Microsoft-Hyper-V", "Containers") -All
      ```
    - Restart your system if required.

7. **Install and Configure Docker**:
    - Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (tested on v4.41+) and install.
    - Ensure Docker is running in **Windows Containers** mode. You can switch to Windows Containers by right-clicking the Docker icon in the system tray and selecting "Switch to Windows Containers."

8. **Build and Run the Docker Container**:
    - Open a terminal in this directory and run the following command to build and start the container:
      ```sh
      docker-compose up --build
      ```
    - Once the container is running, the server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

9. **Add a User**:
    - Open container PowerShell by running the following command:
      ```sh
      docker exec -it <Your-Container-Name> powershell
      ```
    - Add a user with your desired credentials:
      ```sh
      .\Store.UserAdmin\bin\PDS.WITSMLstudio.Store.UserAdmin.exe add -u <Your-Username> -p <Your-Password> -e <Your-Email>
      ```
      ![powershell-create-user](img/powershell-create-user.png)

Access the server at `http://localhost:8080/api/soap` using:
- **Username**: `<Your-Username>`
- **Password**: `<Your-Password>`

Use [PDS WITSMLstudio Desktop](https://witsml.pds.technology/studio/) if no client is available.

<summary>Use Docker image</summary>

Make sure to enable the required Windows features and restart your system if required:
```sh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $("Microsoft-Hyper-V", "Containers") -All
```

To run the WITSML server with a MongoDB backend, follow one of the two setup methods below:

1. **Run your container by one of the following method**:

    1. **Use docker compose**:

        You can easily deploy the WITSML server and MongoDB using Docker Compose. Below is the configuration:

          ```yaml
          services:
            iis:
              image: nazebzurati/witsml:latest
              ports:
                - "8080:80"
              depends_on:
                - mongodb
              networks:
                - witsml-network

            mongodb:
              image: mongo:6.0
              container_name: mongodb
              ports:
                - "27017:27017"
              networks:
                - witsml-network

          networks:
            witsml-network:
          ```

    2. **Use command**:

        Alternatively, you can set up the server and MongoDB with a single command. Run the following commands:

        ```sh
        docker network create --driver nat witsml-network
        docker run -d --name mongodb --network witsml-network -p 27017:27017 mongo:6.0
        docker run -d --name witsml --network witsml-network -p 8080:80 nazebzurati/witsml:latest
        ```
2. **Setup your container**:

    Once the container is running, you'll need to complete some setup steps:

    - Access the container's PowerShell: \
      Run the following command to open a PowerShell session within the container:

      ```sh
      docker exec -it witsml powershell
      ```

    - Add a User: \
      To add a user with your desired credentials, run the following command:

      ```sh
      .\Store.UserAdmin\bin\PDS.WITSMLstudio.Store.UserAdmin.exe add -u <Your-Username> -p <Your-Password> -e <Your-Email>
      ```

Access the server at `http://localhost:8080/api/soap` using:
- **Username**: `<Your-Username>`
- **Password**: `<Your-Password>`

Use [PDS WITSMLstudio Desktop](https://witsml.pds.technology/studio/) if no client is available.
